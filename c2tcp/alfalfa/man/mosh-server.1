.SH NAME
mosh-server \- server-side helper for mosh

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmosh-server\fP is a helper program for the 
.BR mosh(1)
remote terminal application.

\fBmosh-server\fP binds to a high UDP port and chooses an encryption
key to protect the session. It prints both on standard output,
detaches from the terminal, and waits for the \fBmosh-client\fP to
establish a connection. It will exit if no client has contacted
it within 60 seconds.

By default, \fBmosh-server\fP binds to a port between 60000 and
61000 and executes the user's login shell.

On platforms with \fButempter\fP, \fBmosh-server\fP maintains an entry
in the
.BR utmp(5)
file to indicate its process ID, whether the session is connected,
and the client's current IP address.

\fBmosh-server\fP exits when the client terminates the connection.

.SH OPTIONS

The argument "new" must be first on the command line to use
command-line options.

.TP
.B \-l \fINAME=VALUE\fP

environment, if the startup environment does not specify a character
set of UTF-8.
